            <p>The government on Monday notified the Passenger Name Record (PNR) Information Regulations, 2022, making
                it mandatory for any operating flight to share details of international travellers with a customs
                agency. Among these are details of a person’s ticket — when it was booked, date of travel and billing
                information — and data about their travel, such as origin, destination, and how many bags they are
                carrying. Also included will be their seat numbers and co-passenger data. The government, in the
                notification, said the objective is to create an advance risk assessment to combat crimes under the
                excise law and for sharing of intelligence with other law enforcement agencies. As safeguards, the
                notification says such data will be subject to privacy laws in force, avoid certain types of information
                (like race and religion) and be processed only within a secure system.

                India isn’t the first country to set up such as system. In 2016, the European Union (EU) adopted the PNR
                Directive for all its member countries. Even before the directive, the EU and the United States (US)
                signed a pact in 2011 to share PNR records. A veritable data dragnet, such systems became expedient in
                the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001 and the terror strikes that followed in parts of
                Europe later that decade. The US operates an even more sophisticated system called the Automated
                Targeting System. While little is known about the American system, the data sought by India suggests
                Delhi’s requirements may lie somewhere in between the European and the American models in terms of
                scope.</p>

            <P>A week after the Capital got its new police commissioner, Delhi Police released data on the city’s crime
                graph. According to the police, cases of crime across most categories, such as theft, snatching, and
                burglary, increased by 8.1% (till July 15) compared to the same period last year. Crimes against women
                have also seen a spike. The city, which has a reputation for being unsafe for women, reported more cases
                of kidnapping, molestation, rape, and cruelty by spouses. Overall, the city reported a 16.9% increase in
                such cases.

                Senior police officers told HT that the spurt in the number of criminal cases could be due to the online
                FIR registration system, which has made it easier for citizens to report crimes. But many residents feel
                that the debilitating economic impact of Covid-19 has led to an increase in the crime rate and that the
                case numbers could be higher than the data show.</P>
